# quills-scrollshop
Quills Art Store is a digital archive curated by Cleopatra Morgan (Cleo 73200108), designed to host original glyphs, sigils, and mythic prints. This repository lays the groundwork for future collections including CyberEgypt and Scroll Syndicates, and will eventually link to external shops like ArtPal, Ko-fi, and Etsy.
